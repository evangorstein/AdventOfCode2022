            "Early smartphones targeted the enterprise market, combining PDA functionality with cellular telephony, but were limited by bulky form, short battery life, slow networks, and immature wireless data services. These issues were resolved with Moore's Law, improved lithium-ion batteries, faster digital mobile data networks, and more mature software platforms. Early smartphones were hybrid devices that combined PDA OSes with basic phone hardware. The first commercially available smartphone was the IBM Simon, which was unsuccessful due to its bulky form and limited battery life. Other landmark devices included the Ericsson R380, Kyocera 6035, Nokia 9210 Communicator, and Handspring's Treo 180. NTT DoCoMo's i-mode platform provided early mobile internet access.\n",
            "Japanese phones offered advanced services tailored to the local market, such as mobile payments and NFC, but used custom firmware and lacked standardized operating systems for third-party app development. Nokia's Symbian was popular in Europe, while in the US, smartphones were mainly used by business professionals and early adopters due to high data plan costs. The iPhone's introduction in 2007 shifted the smartphone form factor to large capacitive touchscreens and introduced multi-touch gestures. Its operating system was powerful enough to run a full web browser and a centralized App Store, which quickly became the new paradigm for all smartphone platforms.\n",
            "The development of Android was affected by the belief that a physical keyboard was necessary, resulting in the release of the first Android device with a slide-out keyboard. Manufacturers have attempted to make smartphones thinner, but this has resulted in reduced battery capacity and sturdiness. Attempts to compete with Android and iPhone, such as Palm's webOS and Microsoft's Windows Phone, were short-lived and resulted in little market share. BlackBerry pivoted to producing Android devices and exited the hardware market to focus on software. Despite the growth of Windows Phone, it never gained significant market share and Microsoft took a $7.6 billion write-off on the Nokia assets.\n",
            "Nokia released Android-based smartphones for emerging markets before being sold to Microsoft. The Huawei P30 has three rear-facing cameras with Leica optics. The first camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210 in 1999. By 2011, almost all smartphones had an integrated camera, leading to a decline in sales of stand-alone cameras. Nokia introduced mobile optical image stabilization in 2012 with the Lumia 920. Samsung's Galaxy S4 Zoom smartphone had a 10x optical zoom lens and manual parameter settings. In 2017, Apple introduced real-time augmented reality camera effects. Viewfinder intuition was introduced in iOS 7, allowing exposure value to be adjusted through vertical swiping.\n",
            "The 2014 Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 combined mobile phone and compact camera features, with a 1\" image sensor and light sensitivities up to ISO 25600. HTC's One M7 and M8 used UltraPixel technology for improved low light performance, while the M8 also featured a dual camera setup. The LG Mobile experimented with time-of-flight camera functionality in 2014. In 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 Plus with a dual camera setup, and in 2018, Huawei released the P20 Pro with a triple camera lens setup. Samsung's Galaxy A9 (2018) had the world's first quad camera setup, while the Nokia 9 PureView featured a penta-lens camera system. Mobile video resolution has increased over the years, with the Samsung Omnia HD becoming the first phone with 720p HD video recording in 2009, and the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Redmi K30 Pro introducing 4320p (8K) filming in 2020. Mid-range smartphones have been slower to adopt higher video resolutions.\n",
            "Smartphones have evolved significantly in terms of camera technology. Slow-motion video recording was first introduced on the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II, and since then, various brands have added this feature to their devices, with some models offering up to 2160p at 120fps. Front cameras have also seen improvements, with some devices boasting resolutions as high as 16 megapixels. Display technology has also advanced, with taller aspect ratios and \"bezel-less\" designs becoming more common, as well as the introduction of notches to house front-facing cameras.\n",
            "Smartphone displays have evolved over the years with the introduction of various features such as hole-punch cameras, higher refresh rates, and foldable displays. The first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the Motorola Atrix 4G in 2011. LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories in 2016. Samsung and LG used to offer flagship devices with user-replaceable batteries but have since moved away from this feature. As of 2015, the global median for smartphone ownership was 43%, with Statista forecasting that 2.87 billion people would own smartphones in 2020. Major technologies that began to trend in 2016 included virtual and augmented reality experiences, USB-C connectors, and improving LTE technologies.\n",
            "Smartphone technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, with features such as variable screen refresh rates, embedded fingerprint readers, multi-camera systems, facial recognition and waterproofing becoming standard. Many of these design elements were first introduced by Apple and have since been adopted by other manufacturers. In 2020, the first 5G smartphones were announced, and there is a growing trend of reducing the environmental footprint by shipping devices without accessories such as power adapters and headphones. There are also efforts to make open source GNU/Linux for smartphones a major alternative to iOS and Android, and some smartphones can be used as basic desktop computers. Finally, satellite connectivity is being integrated into smartphones for use in remote areas.\n"

              "'The text discusses the evolution of smartphones, starting with their early days in the enterprise market and going up to present-day features. Early smartphones faced several issues such as bulky form, short battery life, slow networks, and immature data services. However, these issues were resolved with the advancement of technology, which led to the integration of PDA functionality with cellular telephony, improved lithium-ion batteries, Moore\\'s Law, faster digital mobile data networks, and more mature software platforms.\\n\\nIn addition, smartphones have evolved in terms of display, camera, and connectivity technology. The first commercially available device was the IBM Simon, which was unsuccessful due to its bulky form and limited battery life. The advent of the iPhone in 2007 shifted the smartphone form factor to large capacitive touchscreens and introduced multi-touch gestures. In terms of camera technology, the introduction of mobile optical image stabilization was made in 2012 with the Lumia 920, while Samsung\\'s Galaxy S4 Zoom had a 10x optical zoom lens and manual parameter settings. Mobile video resolution has also increased over the years, with mid-range smartphones being slower to adopt higher video resolutions.\\n\\nSmartphone displays have also seen improvements in taller aspect ratios and \"bezel-less\" designs becoming more common, as well as notches to house front-facing cameras. Various display features such as hole-punch cameras, higher refresh rates, and foldable displays have been introduced. The first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the Motorola Atrix 4G in 2011, and other design elements such as multi-camera systems, facial recognition, and waterproofing have also become standard features.\\n\\nThe use of smartphones is also becoming more widespread, with a forecast of 2.87 billion people owning smartphones in 2020. Major technologies that began to trend in 2016 include virtual and augmented reality experiences, USB-C connectors, and improving LTE technologies. The first 5G smartphones were announced in 2020, which further illustrates how smartphone technology is advancing rapidly.\\n\\nFinally, there are efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of the smartphones, including shipping devices without accessories such as power adapters and headphones. There are efforts to make open source GNU/Linux for smartphones a major alternative to iOS and Android, and some smartphones can be used as basic desktop computers. Additionally, satellite connectivity is being integrated into smartphones for use in remote areas.'"
